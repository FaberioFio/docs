Machine learning refers to the study of statistical models to *solve specific problems* with patterns and inferences.

2.1. Machine Learning Categories

We can broadly categorize machine learning into supervised and
unsupervised categories based on the approach. There are other
categories as well, but we'll keep ourselves to these two:

○ Supervised learning works with a **set of data that contains both
the inputs and the desired output** — for instance, a data set
containing various characteristics of a property and the
expected rental income. Supervised learning is further divided
into two broad sub-categories called classification and
regression:
■ Classification algorithms are related to categorical
output, like whether a property is occupied or not
■ Regression algorithms are related to a continuous output
range, like the value of a property

○ Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, *works with a set of
data which only have input values*. It works by trying to
identify the inherent structure in the input data. For
instance, finding different types of consumers through a data
set of their consumption behavior.
