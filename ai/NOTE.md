- Algorithm is the most important thing in AI field 

1 understand it
2 and can apply effectively

is the most important for me and majority of people

Example: I want to detect object in real time. 

- Any thing that  is more important than Algorithm ??

That is the DATA. NO, NOT the DATA, BUT the QUALITY data

First, QUANTITY
Then, QUALITY > QUANTITY

- importance in order

Data > Algorithm > Framework > Deployment
