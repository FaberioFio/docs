MongoDB is a document database used in many modern web applications. It is
classified as a NoSQL database because it does not rely on a traditional
table-based relational database structure.

Instead, it uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, meaning that, unlike
relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema before you
add data to a database. You can alter the schema at any time and as often as is
necessary without having to set up a new database with an updated schema.
