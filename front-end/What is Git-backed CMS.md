### Definition

Changes are first pushed to your Git repository which then triggers a new build of your site. Git-based CMSs act as a layer on top of Git and are interacting directly with Git repo

### Pros

    Full version control on all content out of the box.
    All content is present as flat files so developers can use all the tools they typically use.
    It is easy to roll back.
    This is the most homogenous approach for most web developers thanks to the existing git-based workflow.
    No bandwidth or data caps
    No vendor lock-in.
    Simple setup.

### Cons

    If you want to use several apps or sites to pull content from the same CMS, a git-based option might not be the best solution.
    If your site has tons of content, you may want to look into the database instead.
    If you plan on changing content rapidly, like new posts every minute, the Git-based option is not the best option for you.
    Limited options. Less control over content model and formating.
    You need a separate service for media files (repo size limits).
