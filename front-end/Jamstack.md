JAMstack is *an approach to frontend web development* (the construction of content and interfaces that users interact with). It allows developers to quickly create and efficiently serve static websites to users.

What are the benefits of using JAMstack?

    Performance: Almost all of the content in a JAMstack application is made up of static HTML files that are served from a CDN. This is the fastest way to deliver web content to end users.

    Scalability: If an application is "scalable," that means that it responds well to large increases in usage. Because the JAMstack frontend is fast and the backend is lightweight, JAMstack applications are often extremely scalable.

    Better developer experience: JAMstack enables developers to focus on building a compelling frontend user experience, without worrying about the backend or performance issues.
