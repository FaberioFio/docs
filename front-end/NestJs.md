##  Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to create a REST api that performs crud
operations using TypeORM and postgresql. We will cover how to setup TypeORM,
creating entities, repositories and use in our services to fetch data and
integrate with our controllers.

Http server can use with fastify or express

## My comments

CLI is very powerfull too like rails.
Has many 'Computer Science' terms when working with nest. So can learn so many things.
But it's very confused for beginners.

Cons: 
My first impression is NOT good.
Try this to know that. 1 tieng van chua xong lam theo tutorial
