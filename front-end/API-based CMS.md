API-driven CMS or API-first CMS or API-based CMS is a headless CMS that serves your content via an API, typically a REST API or GraphQL, allowing you to have your content completely decoupled from the presentation. So, you are getting your data and the way it is structured but it depends on you to choose which framework and language you will use to work with it.
Pros

    This is the best solution if you have several different apps or websites that pull the same managed content.
    Easy to use content with multiple front-ends.
    Most available options give you the ability to customize CMS completely to your liking.
    You can handle huge amounts of data easily.
    Asset management. Unlike Git solutions, most API-driven products come with the ability to upload and manage assets.

Cons

    This version is not controlled in Git and it is also not integrated into developer workflow as git-based CMS. Now, although this is more of a difference in architecture and approach, some people take it as a downside. We’re just making you aware of it.
    Usually comes with storage and API usage limits. It can be costly if you don’t plan things well.
    Dependency on devs for bigger changes.
