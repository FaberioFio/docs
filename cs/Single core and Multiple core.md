### Core Count of CPU

`A multicore CPU` will help your laptop do more at the same time by breaking down complex computations into smaller pieces. This means that each piece of computation in the particular software you’re using can be solved by multiple cores.

dual-core CPU: 2 cores
quad-core CPU: 4 cores
hexa-core CPU: 6 cores. Most used for gaming
hexa-core CPU: 8 cores
hexa-core CPU: 10 cores

### CPU Clock Speed

In general, the higher a CPU’s clock speed, the faster your laptop will be.

3Ghz for one core

- Comparison
This is the number of clock cycles the CPU completes every second. For instance, if you compare a *quad-core* CPU with a 3GHz clock speed against a dual-core CPU with 3.5GHz clock speed. The 3.5GHz dual-core CPU will be faster.

### Multithreading

A single-core CPU can only manage one thread at a time
A single-threaded app can use A multicore CPU, each activity will get a core unto itself. Unless you have more single-threaded apps than cores

### When need multiple-core?

Processing enormous data sets or video editing

A game like Minecraft will run fine on a single core CPU. But a game like Call of Duty will require more than two cores to run smoothly and efficiently.

Multiple cores and threads in a CPU give a powerful experience to the latest games
