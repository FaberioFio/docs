### Problems
Given architecture is an example of a client-server based system. In
this, there is a client who sends requests to the server and then the
client receives a response from the server accordingly but when the
number of users/clients increases, the load on the server increases
enormously which makes it difficult for the server to perform
efficiently and hence becomes slow. Therefore, it is important to make
the server scalable in a way such that the server capacity increases

### My experience

- Kubenetes: Vertical scaling, distribution system, NOT a single point of failure
- VPS: Only with Singapore server, Single point of faliure
