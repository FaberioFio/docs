The key benefit of containers is standardisation. Now that we have a standard interface for all software
operations we can build standardised tools to manage it. That's what
Kubernetes is -- a standardised tool for scheduling (deploying and
running) software.

Logging, monitoring, security, encryption, circuit-breaking and other error-handling, events, etc. are
now all provided by the platform so that your app can focus on business
logic.

The solution to this is to run the same container in prod that you're
using on your desktop.
