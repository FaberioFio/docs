- VPS vs VM 

A VPS is a physical server partitioned into several smaller virtual
servers, with one shared operating system. Whereas a VMware Virtual
Machine, splits the server completely, with each partition running its
own operating system with its own dedicated resources. The fact that the
VPS shares system files can potentially create security issues, as the
userâ€™s information can never be 100% isolated and can therefore never be
100% secure.
