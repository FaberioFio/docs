## Features

Sidekiq uses threads to handle many jobs at the same time in the same process

I also sell Sidekiq Pro and Sidekiq Enterprise, extensions to Sidekiq which provide more
features

Sidekiq let us stop worrying about queues and focus on our app.

- How to run
$ cd path/to/your/app
$ bundle exec sidekiq
the application will add jobs to redis for the Sidekiq process to find and process.
