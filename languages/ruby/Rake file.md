rake is **command line utility of rails**. All commands available for rails are listed here .
writing custom rake task is explained in this post . Below is the definition given for it
in rails doc.

“Rake is Ruby Make, a standalone Ruby utility that replaces the Unix utility ‘make’, and
uses a ‘Rakefile’ and .rake files to build up a list of tasks. In Rails, Rake is used for
common administration tasks, especially sophisticated ones that build off of each other.”

Putting in simple word : “rake will execute different tasks(basically a set of ruby code)
specified in any file with .rake extension from comandline.” .

rake is a gem in itself and installation dependency of rails i,e whenever you install a
rails rake gem get installed along with it.

rails provide a number of inbuilt task like : db:create, db:migrate etc, you have been
familiar with.
