Rails Ruby Ruby Required Rubygems Status
6.1.x 	>= 2.5.0 	3.0.x 	>= 1.8.11 	Maintained

### Pros

- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and CoC (Convention over Configuration)
- Create model, controller, route, db migration in ONE COMMAND
- Model and Database Model (Schema in Rails) is the same. This is totally different from Python-based framework.
- Convention over configure. Such as, `db` is organized into a folder. This is better than django
