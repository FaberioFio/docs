### My Comments

It's based on Starlette and Pydantic, so, it's one of the fastest Python frameworks.

Interface is very same to Flask, but easy to create API without template engine

By using standard type hints with pydantic, FastAPI helps you build APIs that have all
these best practices by default, with little effort.

[ ] Why create model with pydantic ?
