To begin with, Jest is meant to work as a single and independent testing framework, which does not require any additional dependencies.

It strongly depends on the type of the currently developed application. If it were a React or Nest.js application, I’d suggest sticking to the Jest framework, as it’s simply a default option.

However, choosing Mocha could be the way to go for large Node.js projects thanks to its huge flexibility and variety of libraries it provides for an experienced developer
