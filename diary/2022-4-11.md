1 Why Docker is used only in development ?
 
- Until now, I've thought, Docker is used only for deploypment


If you are actively developing an application, using Docker can simplify your
workflow and the process of deploying your application to production. Working
with containers in development offers the following benefits:

  • Environments are consistent, meaning that you can choose the languages and
    dependencies you want for your project without worrying about system
    conflicts.
  • Environments are isolated, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and
    onboard new team members.
  • Environments are portable, allowing you to package and share your code with
    others.
